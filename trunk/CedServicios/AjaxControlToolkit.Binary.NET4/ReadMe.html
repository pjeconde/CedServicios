<h1>AJAX Control Toolkit &mdash; January 2013 Release</h1> 
<p> 
This release of the Ajax Control Toolkit introduces a new set of chart controls and several important
security and bug fixes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    New Chart Controls - This release includes 5 new chart controls: AreaChart, BarChart, BubbleChart, LineChart, and PieChart. 
    All of these controls work with IE9 and newer and recent versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari. 
</li>
<li>HTML Sanitizer - The HTML Sanitizer used by the HtmlEditorExtender has been updated with this release to block 
additional types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks described by OWASP. The Ajax Control Toolkit now contains
over 120 unit tests for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</li> 
<li>
  Request Validation - This release includes an important bug fix concerning a compatibility issue with ASP.NET 4.5
  Request Validation. 
</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Ajax Control Toolkit Version</h2>
<p>
The version number of this release of the Ajax Control Toolkit follows a different format than previous versions. For example, the previous
version of the .NET 3.5 version of the Ajax Control Toolkit was version "3.5.60919" where the number 6 represents the number of years 
that the Ajax Control Toolkit has been released and 0919 represents the date of the release (September 19). 
</p>
<p>
We have reached the 7th year of the Ajax Control Toolkit. Unfortunately, the value "3.5.70123" is incompatible with the
AssemblyVersion attribute because the number 70123 is too large (bigger than a UInt16). Therefore, we switched to using the version format "3.5.7.0123". 
Unlike the previous version format, which worked for 7 years, this new version format should work for 65,534 years.
